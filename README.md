#  House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the use of **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various housing features. The model is built using Python and scikit-learn, and the workflow is executed in **Google Colab**.

##  Files Included
- `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

##  Project Workflow

1. **Data Upload**: Load CSV file using Colab’s file upload method.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encode categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`.
   - Separate features and target (`price`).
3. **Model Building**:
   - Split data into training and test sets.
   - Train a Linear Regression model.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Plot **Actual vs Predicted Prices** using matplotlib.
